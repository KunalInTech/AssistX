# 🤖 AssistX – AI-Based Customer Support System (Design Phase)

AssistX is an **AI-driven customer support system** designed to automate query handling, provide intelligent responses, and seamlessly involve human agents when required. This repository currently represents the **Design Phase** of the project, focusing on system architecture, UML diagrams, and overall workflow planning.

---

## 📌 Project Status

🚧 **Current Phase:** Design Phase
📄 **Included Artifacts:**

* Use Case Diagram (UCD)
* System workflow and actor interactions
* AI decision flow (classification, response, escalation)

Implementation will be carried out in subsequent phases.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of ASSISTX is to design a scalable and intelligent customer support platform that:

* Reduces response time using AI-generated replies
* Handles large volumes of customer queries efficiently
* Escalates complex or low-confidence cases to human agents
* Enables administrators to monitor system performance

---

## ✨ Key Design Highlights

### 👤 User / Customer

* Register and login to the system
* Submit support queries
* Receive automated AI responses

### 🤖 AI System (Conceptual)

* Classifies incoming queries using NLP techniques
* Analyzes context and confidence level
* Generates auto-responses for common issues
* Flags queries for escalation when confidence is low

### 🧑‍💼 Support Agent

* Views escalated tickets
* Resolves customer issues manually
* Provides feedback that can be used to improve AI responses

### 🛠️ Admin

* Monitors overall system performance
* Tracks query resolution and escalation metrics

## 🧩 System Design – Use Case Overview

**Actors:**

* User / Customer
* Support Agent
* Admin

**Major Use Cases:**

* Register / Login
* Submit Support Query
* Classify Query (AI)
* Generate Auto-Response
* Escalate to Support Agent
* Resolve Ticket
* Monitor System Performance

These use cases are represented using UML Use Case Diagrams to clearly define system behavior and responsibilities.
