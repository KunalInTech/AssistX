• The diagram represents a Use Case Diagram for the AssistX – AI-Based Customer Support Automation System.

• The system has three main actors: User, AI Agent, and Admin, each interacting with the system according to their responsibilities.

• Users can register, log in, and raise customer support queries.

• The AI Agent is responsible for classifying queries and generating automated responses.

• The Generate Auto-Response use case includes Classify Query, indicating that classification is mandatory before any response is generated.

• The system may flag a query for escalation if the confidence of the auto-response is low.

• The Flag for Escalation use case extends Generate Auto-Response, showing that escalation is optional and occurs only under specific conditions.

• The Admin logs into the system and accesses the Admin Dashboard.

• The Admin Dashboard allows admins to monitor tickets, view escalated queries, and track system performance.
• The diagram clearly separates human roles (User, Admin) from the automated AI component (AI Agent).

• The system boundary defines all functionalities that belong to AssistX.
