Novelty for the project
Our project introduces a context-aware, AI-driven customer support automation system with intelligent escalation and 
learning from historical tickets, implemented using a scalable Spring Boot architecture.
our novelty lies in combining context retention, intent confidence–based escalation, and 
learning from past resolutions in a single lightweight academic system, rather than just a static chatbot.
